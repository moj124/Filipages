## Motivation
As my final project of CS50x, I decided to create a blog post website in a response to an issue in my hometown of Ilocos Norte, Philippines. They had issues finding certain services such as clincs for certain operations or procedures, as many of people operate via 'word of mouth' hence it's hard to information online. I decided to create a general website that allows users to post about any topic specifically in the region of Ilocos Norte.
